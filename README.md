# Data Structures and Algorithms – HackerRank (Java)

This repository contains my structured practice of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems solved on **HackerRank**, using **Java**.

The purpose of this repository is to build strong DSA fundamentals, enhance logical problem-solving skills, and prepare effectively for **technical interviews and campus placements**.

---

## Repository Objectives

- Strengthen core Data Structures and Algorithms concepts  
- Practice problem-solving in a consistent and organized manner  
- Improve coding skills using Java  
- Maintain a topic-wise reference for quick interview revision  

---

## Programming Language

- **Java**

All solutions are implemented following:
- Clean coding standards  
- Readable and maintainable structure  
- Interview-oriented logic and explanations  

---

## Topics Covered

- Arrays  
- Strings  
- Linked List  
- Stack  
- Queue  
- Hashing  
- Sorting  
- Searching  
- Trees  
- Binary Search Tree

## Problem Documentation Format

Each problem in this repository is documented in a structured and consistent format to ensure clarity and ease of understanding.

Each problem includes:

- **Problem Title**
- **HackerRank Problem Link**
- **Difficulty Level**
- **Problem Description**  
  A clear and concise explanation of the problem statement in simple terms.
- **Approach / Algorithm**  
  Step-by-step explanation of the logic used to solve the problem and the reasoning behind the chosen approach.
- **Code Explanation**  
  Detailed explanation of the Java implementation, including:
  - Key conditions and control flow  
  - Data structures used  
  - Important loops and logic decisions  
- **Java Solution Code**
- **Time Complexity**
- **Space Complexity**

This documentation approach supports both **conceptual understanding** and **interview-oriented revision**.
